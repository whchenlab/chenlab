   Background


   Compromised intestinal barrier (CIB) has been associated with many enteropathies, including colorectal cancer (CRC) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We hypothesized that CIB could lead to increased host-derived contents including epithelial cells into the gut, change its physio-metabolic properties, and globally alter microbial community and metabolic capacities.


   Results


   Consistently, we found host DNA contents (HDCs), calculated as the percentage of metagenomic sequencing reads mapped to the host genome, were significantly elevated in patients of CRC and Crohn’s disease (CD). Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that HDC correlated with microbial- and metabolic-biomarkers of these diseases, contributed significantly to machine-learning models for patient stratification and was consequently ranked as a top contributor. CD patients with treatment could partially reverse the changes of many CD-signature species over time, with reduced HDC and fecal calprotectin (FCP) levels. Strikingly, HDC showed stronger correlations with the reversing changes of the CD-related species than FCP, and contributed greatly in classifying treatment responses, suggesting that it was also a biomarker for effective treatment.


   Conclusions


   Together, we revealed that association between HDCs and gut dysbiosis, and identified HDC as a novel biomarker from fecal metagenomics for diagnosis and effective treatment of intestinal diseases; our results also suggested that host-derived contents may have greater impact on gut microbiota than previously anticipated.
