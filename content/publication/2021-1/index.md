   We were impressed by the excellent results presented by Oh et al., 2020 on a universal gut-microbiome-derived signature that could accurately predict liver cirrhosis (LC) on their own data as well as data from previous studies (Iebba et al., 2018; Qin et al., 2014). Unfortunately, careful examination revealed that many of the selected microbial features, especially the important ones, were likely under the influence of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), drugs used to treat gastrointestinal (GI) disorders (Jackson et al., 2016), and were extensively prescribed in patients with liver cirrhosis
