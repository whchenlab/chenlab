   Evolview is an interactive tree visualization tool designed to help researchers in visualizing phylogenetic trees and in annotating these with additional information. It offers the user with a platform to upload trees in most common tree formats, such as Newick/Phylip, Nexus, Nhx and PhyloXML, and provides a range of visualization options, using fifteen types of custom annotation datasets. The new version of Evolview was designed to provide simple tree uploads, manipulation and viewing options with additional annotation types. The ‘dataset system’ used for visualizing tree information has evolved substantially from the previous version, and the user can draw on a wide range of additional example visualizations. Developments since the last public release include a complete redesign of the user interface, new annotation dataset types, additional tree visualization styles, full-text search of the documentation, and some backend updates. The project management aspect of Evolview was also updated, with a unified approach to tree and project management and sharing. Evolview is freely available at: https://www.evolgenius.info/evolview/.
