   Extrachromosomal mobile genetic elements (eMGEs), including phages and plasmids, that can move across different microbes, play important roles in genome evolution and shaping the structure of microbial communities. However, we still know very little about eMGEs, especially their abundances, distributions and putative functions in microbiomes. Thus, a comprehensive description of eMGEs is of great utility. Here we present mMGE, a comprehensive catalog of 517 251 non-redundant eMGEs, including 92 492 plasmids and 424 759 phages, derived from diverse body sites of 66 425 human metagenomic samples. About half the eMGEs could be further grouped into 70 074 clusters using relaxed criteria (referred as to eMGE clusters below). We provide extensive annotations of the identified eMGEs including sequence characteristics, taxonomy affiliation, gene contents and their prokaryotic hosts. We also calculate the prevalence, both within and across samples for each eMGE and eMGE cluster, enabling users to see putative associations of eMGEs with human phenotypes or their distribution preferences. All eMGE records can be browsed or queried in multiple ways, such as eMGE clusters, metagenomic samples and associated hosts. The mMGE is equipped with a user-friendly interface and a BLAST server, facilitating easy access/queries to all its contents easily. mMGE is freely available for academic use at: https://mgedb.comp-sysbio.org.
